# Auxilia (in development)

This is an Ultima-style RPG for the [GameTank](https://gametank.zone/) which doesn't take itself seriously.

## The story

An evil wizard is threatening the land of Continentalia, sending hordes of monsters who will happily die for him,
even when sent on suicide missions. The wizard is pure evil, so the only course of action is the so-called
"beat-the-stuffing-outta-him" diplomacy. Except he's powerful AF.

There is however a prophecy about a magical artifact that could defeat him, but it's super hard to get.
As if someone placed it in the least convenient location on purpose.

Instead of sending his army's best elements on this dangerous quest, the ruler of the land, Lord Continental,
prefers to rely on an inexperienced rando. This is absolutely not because he's afraid his population would
overthrow him should he deplete the army keeping people in check.

Congratulations hero! Yes, you. No backsies.
